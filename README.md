# 16-Bit-Processor
In this project, we have replicated a 16-Bit-Processor, that makes use of a Single Bus Functionality. We have used python for the same. 
Special Thanks to *@Reeshan Joarder* and *@vaibhav-INDIE* for designing the Decoder unit, and *@vineetcoder5* for helping me in designing the ALU unit. 

The following are the features of our processor :

    ADD 
    SUB
    BIWTISE - AND
    BITWISE - XOR
    STORE
    LOAD
a
The components included along with the processor are as follows :

    ALU - for computing Arithmetical and Logical Operations
    DECODER - for decoding the type of instructions
    PC (Program Counter) - help read the next instruction
    IR (Instruction Register) - for incrementing the value of the PC and helping decode the instruction in the PC
    REGISTERS - for storing data

The Instruction Encoding and other required information are given in the ***Specifications.txt***. 
Sample instructions are included in the ***Instructions.txt*** and Data is provided in ***Data.txt***
